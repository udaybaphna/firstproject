# print("Uday Baphna")
# print(25+89)
# print("I can print string in all 3 typer of inverted coma's 1,2,3")
# print(type("I also can print type like Boolean,string,int,float"),type(99))

#print sum of 2 numbers
# a=5
# b=10.67
# print(a+b)

# so we can't add string with int/float but int and float can be added

# a="we"
# b=8
# r=a+str(b)
# print(r)
# so if you want to print a string and a int togeter without space we need to force int to be string in a new string and then print it but if we can put space then it is ok we dont need a new variable

# interger division //
# it means it will ivide but ans will be int will display as a float

# Doubt 1
# import math
# a=5
# b=8.0
# v=a//b
# # print(type(v))
# # print(v)
# print(math.ceil(v))
# h=9.89
# print(math.ceil(h)) 

# a=5
# b=-56
# v=a//b
# print(v)

# remainder gets negative if denominater is negative
# import math
# a=5
# b=8.0
# v=a//b
# print(math.ceil(v))

# floor is oppsite of ceil

# a= input("name:")
# print(a)
# for inputing string it is direct but for int and float you have to specify before input

# name=input("name:")
# age=int(input("age:"))

# print("My name is ",name,"I am ",age,"year old")
